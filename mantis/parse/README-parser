Documentation for Mantis data parsing tools.
-------------------------------------------

Accumulate data from logfile and various utilization traces into a single CSV with one column for each metric and one row for each timestamp.

Main program is data_parse.pl.  There are different modules for each type of trace; currently:
* CPU_Ut: CPU utilization according to sar
* CPU_Freq: CPU frequency according to a simple polling bash script
* Disk: Disk stats from iostat
* Power: AC power measurements from brandelect scripts
* Perfctr: CPU performance counter data from perfmon
If trace syntax changes, these modules will have to be modified.
